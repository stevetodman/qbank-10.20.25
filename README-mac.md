# CHD Q‑Bank (macOS)

This package contains a self-contained HTML quiz and a one-click launcher for macOS.

## Files
- **CHD-QBank.html** — the full quiz (open in any browser)
- **Run CHD Q-Bank.command** — double‑click to launch in your default browser
- **README-mac.md** — this help file

## Quick Start
1) **Unzip** the downloaded archive.
2) **Double‑click** `Run CHD Q-Bank.command`.
   - If macOS warns that it’s from the internet, choose **Open**. If you only see “Move to Trash”, right‑click → **Open** to get the Open option.
3) The quiz opens in your default browser. You can also just double‑click `CHD-QBank.html` directly.

## Add to Dock (optional)
- Drag `Run CHD Q-Bank.command` to the **right** side of the Dock (near the Downloads/Trash area) for quick access.

## Gatekeeper note (first run only)
macOS may block new `.command` files. If it does:
- Right‑click the file → **Open** → **Open**.
- Or allow it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Security** (click **Open Anyway**).

## Emailing this to someone
- Attach the file **CHD-QBank-mac.zip** to an email. Recipients just unzip and double‑click the `.command` (or open the HTML file).

## Updating the questions
Replace `CHD-QBank.html` with a newer version; the launcher will keep working.

Enjoy!
